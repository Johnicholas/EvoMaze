EvoMaze - A toy computational evolution project, in Java
===

EvoMaze is a tiny Java program (I've committed the full Eclipse project) that evolves 2D mazes using a very basic evolutionary setup. I've commented it here or there but right now it's in a very basic state. I might add to it over time but it's most presented "as-is", for use however you see fit (you don't need attribution, even, though I'd love to know what you use it for so do email me - mike@gamesbyangelina.org)

I use computational evolution in my day-to-day work as a researcher and PhD student. I'm building a system that can design games autonomously called ANGELINA. For more information, go to http://www.gamesbyangelina.org

If you need to ask a question about this code, email mike@gamesbyangelina.org and I'll do my best to answer. Strictly speaking it's not really being "maintained", it's just here in case someone finds it useful.

(I, Johnicholas, am editing and porting this code in order to understand it.)
